 1. requirements
    build requirements:
    - cmake
    - gcc
    - libcurl
    - a2x / asciidoc (required to build manpages)

    run requirements:
    - libcurl

 2. building
    There are a few build options, and their defaults, that you can specify:
    NOGZIP - "OFF"
        Whether to disable compressing manpages with gzip. 
        Turn this on if you wish to disable gzip manpage compression,
        as some packaging utilities will do the gzip compression step for you.
    CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX - "/usr/local"
        The target prefix that make install will install to.
        This is what you would expect from "./configure --prefix=foo"
    CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE - "MinSizeRel"
        Specifies the build type for make based generators.
        Possible values: Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo, MinSizeRel

    The build steps are:
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake -DNOGZIP=OFF -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ..
    $ make

 3. installing
    # after building, while in the build directory
    $ make install

 4. using
    $ cronkite -search vim
     > lots
     > of 
     > data
    $ cronkite -info vim
     > info
     > about
     > package
     > vim
